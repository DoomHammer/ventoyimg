[![Build img](https://github.com/catherinedoyel/ventoyimg/actions/workflows/blank.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/catherinedoyel/ventoyimg/actions/workflows/blank.yml)

Images with Ventoy installed &amp; distros ready to boot.

These images such as 256MB should fit onto 256MB media like usb drive or sd card. Avalible use for iso, img, & efi will be lower due to file system overhead and the 32MB VTOYEFI partition.
Smaller and bigger releases to come.
Do not rely these releases yet. Any files you download labeled as billed are not widely tested.
This repository may not always have the distros embedded. The process is very automated but still relies on a commit to create new build files.
